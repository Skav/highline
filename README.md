# My first project

## Years

I started this project in 2016. It has been writen in kohana

##  History

I wanted to learn programming, my first try was in c++ but it didn't take so long to abandon this idea, then i've started from PHP.
Actually i never wrote a real site in vanillia PHP, I immediately started with framework after I found out writting with celar PHP had no sense

## Ok, but what it is for?

it was supposed to be a site for ets2 virtual comapny, then i had not idea what VS' needed so i start from basic.

On site we have a:

For users:
Login, logout and register panel <br/>
Truck info <br/>
User info <br/>
Adding new routes <br/>
Repair panel <br/>
User panel <br/>
Simple PM's system <br/>

For admins:
Adding users with trucks <br/>
delete users <br/>
Panel for accept driver routes <br/>
permission panel <br/>

## and for the end, i know nobody cares about this project v:
